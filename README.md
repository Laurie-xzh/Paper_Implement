# Introduction
In fact, most work of this reposotiry is the reproduce of some papers. Some works are so interesting that I want to run the model by myself. I try to do some experiment with the open-source code. the folds named '.../[model name]-main' are the open-source code. For example, ./Detection/detr/detr-main is the code on https://github.com/facebookresearch/detr. I will write some logs about the reproduce and experiment results. I am a junior student major in AI. Some of my thoughts and attempts still have a lot of shortcomings, welcome your criticism and correction!
